# Visualization of COVID-19 pandemic the US over time

How can we visualize and better understand the overall toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on US counties or county equivalents

## Business Question 
How can we, as leaders of the country, be able to look at the amount of cases of COVID-19 overtime in the US and understand to what degree it is spreading and impacting communites?

## Data Analysis
The Google Colaboratory Notebook was used to conduct this analysis. First, four packages were loaded. Then, the data was imported by connecting the source, Johns Hopkins Data. The data was then cleaned to allow for both a heat denisty map and bubble map and finished with a color denisty scale which changed by color there was a higher concentration of cases. This allowed a better visualization of the spread of COVID-19. 

The following is the graph of the data collection.*
